# Audio_Processing
## Introduction
This project is developed using Vitis Classic 2023.2 and targets the PYNQ-Z2 development board. The primary focus is on signal analysis, signal generation, and the implementation of digital filters. This endeavor is part of an academic exercise aimed at exploring the capabilities of FPGA in processing digital signals. The PYNQ-Z2 board, with its rich set of features and integration with Python, allows for a hands-on approach to understanding digital signal processing (DSP) and its applications in real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites
To get started with this project, you will need: <br>

**Hardware:** PYNQ-Z2 FPGA development board. <br>
**Software:** Vitis Classic 2023.2. Ensure that you have the Vitis Core Development Kit installed and configured properly for your system. <br>
&nbsp; Audacity for signal analysis.
